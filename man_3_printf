.SH NAME
_printf \- print output according to a format.

.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf();

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a specified format. Writes the output to stdout, to the standard output stream.

This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted to output.

The format string is a string of characters, beginning and ending in its initial change state. It is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters, each of which results in the fetching of subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be, in order, zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision, and an optional length modifier.

.SH OPTIONS
.SH c
The int argument is converted to a character, and the resulting character is written.

.SH s
The characters in the array are written up to and including the terminating null byte ('\0').

.SH d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The default value of precision is 1. When it is 0 it is printed with an explicit precision 0, and the output is empty.

.SH SEE ALSO
printf(1), puts(3), scanf(3). 

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
